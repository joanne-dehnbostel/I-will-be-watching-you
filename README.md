# I-will-be-watching-you 
a set of eyes that will watch your mouse move around the screen, I can't help humming the tune by the Police when I see this project run.


***

How to Run the Project:

***
<ul>
<li>Simply click on the link on the projects or bootstrap inspirations page to run the eyes project.</li>
<li>The creepy eyes will follow your mouse and may see into your soul. </li>
<li>Try not to hum the song "I'll be watching you" after seeing this site.</li>
</ul>

Future improvements will include adding different backgrounds- imagine the outline of a cat or a bear or even a yeti. The user could choose which background they would like to see.
